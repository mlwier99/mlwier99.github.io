# About Me
 I am a Pittsburgh-based problem-solver and political scientist with extensive experience in building, preparing, and analyzing large, novel data sets. My research has primarily concered the role of women in the legal system. However, my interests are broad and I have worked on research teams covering many different topics. I hold an MA in political science from the University of Pittsburgh and a BA from the University of Mississippi.
